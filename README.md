Demonstrates how to use the Fused Location Provider API to get updates about a device's location. The Fused Location Provider is part of the Google Play services Location APIs.

This uses the [FusedLocationProviderClient] (https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/LocationServices.html).
